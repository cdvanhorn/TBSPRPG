# TBSPRPG

This is a game engine for text based online single player role playing games (TBSPRPG).  This will be written in a Javascript framework, probably Angular.  This project will have everything you need to write your own TBSPRPG.  What will make the games unique is the data retrieved from the backend API.  I'm currently working on the story for my game, work will pickup on this project when I have the story nailed down.  I'm going to start with something small and gradually build larger stories.

This will be the backend of the site, it will be a REST API written in .NET core.
